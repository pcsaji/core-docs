# CORE
The IOS-MCN 5G project is a 4G/5G disaggregated mobile core optimized for public cloud deployment in concert with distributed edge clouds. It exposes standard 3GPP interfaces enabling use of SD-Core as a conventional mobile core.  It can be rapidly deployed pre-integrated with Aether, as a standalone 5G/4G mobile core, or as control and dataplane (UPF) components integrated into custom designed solutions. This range of versatility makes the open source IOS-MCN Core platform for the developers of 5G core solution providers.
